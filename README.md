# Data Center Siting Analysis and Predictive Modeling at the County Level

## Motivation

With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, data centers have become critical infrastructure supporting the development and deployment of AI models. As demand for computational resources continues to grow, data centers are attracting substantial investment and playing an increasingly important role in regional economic and technological development.

Motivated by this trend, this project aims to explore the factors that influence data center siting decisions and to investigate whether location-level features can be used to predict counties that are suitable for data center development.
  
## Background

This is a personal research-oriented project that aligns with the author’s academic interests. The project was initially developed as part of a course assignment and has since been extended to incorporate a broader data pipeline, feature engineering, and predictive modeling framework.
